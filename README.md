# Blackjack With Your Friends - Express Server

### Backend Node.js/Express server for the Blackjack With Your Friends app.

### NOTE:

If you are cloning this repo to run locally, make sure to run `npx tsc` or `npm run build` to create the `dist` directory.

- TypeScript compiles all of the `.ts` files to `.js` and outputs them into the `dist` directory, and the server is running from `/dist/server/index.js`.
